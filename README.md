Loans are the core business of banks.
The main profit comes directly from the
loan’s interest. The loan companies
grant a loan after an intensive process
of verification and validation. However,
they still don’t have assurance if the
applicant is able to repay the loan with
no difficulties. This model helps to do the same.
